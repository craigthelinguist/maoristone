-> Download the mingw binaries from the SDL website


-> From the appropriate folder (x86, x64 or whatever they are called), do:


- copy the contents of 'include' at 'mingw/include/SDL2/'

- copy the contents of 'lib' at 'mingw/lib'


- copy the contents of 'bin' at 'mingw/bin'*


Then, you will be able to compile all SDL2 projects by doing the following:


#include SDL2 files like this:


#include "SDL2/SDL.h"


And add the following at the extra linker settings (note the order):


-lSDL2_main -lSDL2
