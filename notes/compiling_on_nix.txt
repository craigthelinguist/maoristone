You will need to install the libsdl2 library. This can be done with your operating system's package manager. For Debian-like distros you can do:

sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev

Otherwise you can manually build the source from this website:

http://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php#source

Once installation is complete, you can include the file AN_SDL_FILE.h with the line:

#include <SDL2/AN_SDL_FILE.h>
